# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    

### Purpose
    This challenge allowed students to practice creating columns, craft Pivot tables, perform advanced Pivot table functions, prepare line graphs, and save engineered tables as resource photos. The countifs function offered an opportunity for students to expand their wings with understanding Excel functions on their own. A video and written instructional source guided the class in operating tasks required for their assignment, such as countifs. 

    Louise had performed a fundraiser via Kickstarter. Naturally, Louise was curious how her campaign faired in comparison to likewise campaigns. This first challenge involved utilizing Excel skills to assist Louise with analyzing outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

   One quick look at the Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph supplies one with a rapid determination that the most successful campaigns were launched in May. June and July did not fare quite as well as May; however, these two months surpassed baseline succesful campaigns. 

   The peak of the failed campaigns is November. It is no wonder as to why November is not successful for garnering donations. Christmas is right around the corner. March and September also shared the same response as November. At this time the writer does not have any guesses as to why this March and September would be unsuccesful as well.

   The canceled campaigns all have one thing in common. They do not ever surpass the 20 line on the bar graph. One single month was canceled, October. Writer wonders if October was canceled due to the dramatic drop seen in both successful and unsuccesful September campaigns. Writer also wonders why December was not also canceled. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The 25000 to 34999 range appears to be the most unsuccessful campaigns. An upward trend in failed campgains can be seen beginning in the 10000 to 19999 range. A sharp upward failure peaks between the 20000 to 25000.

It stands to reason that the grey, canceled line lies flat on the percent succesful grid. If the campaigns are canceled they cannot be succesful. 

Interestingly donation success percentage began to climb after the 34999 range. Louise's 35000 to 39999 range was only surpassed by the less than 1000 to 49999 range. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This assignment led to many challenges and difficulties. Writer went from being completely unfamiliar with advanced pivot table functions to building a moderate comfort level with crafting graphs. Many thank yous to those who wrote the challenge instructions. The wonderful detail, hints, and photos allowed writer to feel confident in her work created.

One challenge faced was during the Outcomes Based on Launch Date sheet. Writer could not figure out how to modify row labels from quarters to months. It took a bit of playing around with controls and searching to locate the correct arrow to format the rows into months. Writer thought that the process of converting from quarters to months would be a multistep process; however, the simple arrow click set things right.

Another difficulty was during the crafting of the countif codes. Writer had taken notes during class time and attempted to use the notes with no success. The Excel tip sheet submitted as a resource during class was a help for this task. Writer also took some time to remember the necessity for the $ sign prior to row/cell value to prevent the information from changing cell to cell. 



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The most successful campaign was launched in May.
The least succesful campaign was launched in November.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The 1000 to 49999 range campaign was the most successful.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset is rather small in comparison to the higher dollar amounts sought. Our Succes Percent by Goal indicated an continuing increace in donations at the highest end range. Would a larger dataset allow this range to surpass the 1000 to 4999 range? 
For our analysis we only reviewed theater success. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A pie graph could be created to illustrate percent successful.
A stacked bar graph couled be utilized to illustrate succesful, unsuccessful, and canceled.
